#The implemented solution uses a custom Python tracing framework to manage end-to-end execution logging and monitoring. One file handles the main application logic and invokes the tracing APIs, while the TraceLib module manages execution lifecycle events by registering job start and end times, capturing logs, tracking execution status, and sending consolidated trace information to a centralized Azure logging service. This ensures consistent auditing, error tracking, and operational visibility across batch executions.
