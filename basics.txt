1️⃣ The Engine Starts

The system reads configuration:

Which folder to scan

Hash algorithm

Chunk size

Logging level

Logging is initialized

The ProcessingEngine is created

👉 This engine controls the entire workflow.

2️⃣ Directory Scanning (Memory-Efficient)

The engine tells the DirectoryScanner:

“Start walking through this directory and give me files one at a time.”

Important points:

It does not load all files into a list

Files are yielded one by one

Works even for huge directories

Permission errors are skipped safely

This is what keeps the system fast and memory-safe.

3️⃣ Metadata Extraction (Fast System Calls)

For each file:

File name

Absolute path

Size

Creation time

Last modified time

Extension

This uses OS-level stats, so it’s very fast.

The result is a FileMetadata object, which is:

Immutable

Clean

Safe to pass around

4️⃣ File Type Classification

Based on the file extension, the system decides:

Document

Image

Log

Archive

Binary

Unknown

This helps later when we:

Count files by type

Analyze storage usage

Generate meaningful reports

5️⃣ Hashing (Duplicate Detection Foundation)

Now comes the important performance part.

Instead of:
❌ Reading the entire file into memory

The system:

Reads the file in small chunks

Updates the hash incrementally

Works for very large files

This creates a unique fingerprint for each file.

6️⃣ Duplicate Detection

Files with the same hash are:

Grouped together

Marked as duplicates

We store:

Original file

All duplicate paths

This approach is:

Accurate

Scales linearly

Industry standard

7️⃣ Analysis Phase

While files are processed, the system keeps updating:

Total file count

Total disk usage

File count by type

Largest files

Nothing complex here — just efficient aggregation.

8️⃣ Report Generation

Once scanning is done, the system generates a report showing:

How many files were scanned

How much disk space is used

File distribution by type

Largest files

Duplicate file groups

The report is:

Offline

Human-readable

Easy to extend to CSV/JSON
