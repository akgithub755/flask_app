1️⃣ First, the BIG PICTURE (very important)

In France, retail data mainly comes from two completely different worlds:

World	Who provides data	What kind of data
🏪 Retailer world	Supermarkets	What is sold in stores
👨‍👩‍👧 Consumer world	Households (panelists)	What people buy & consume

Now:

BDD Gestpan belongs to 👉 Consumer / Panel world

GPM belongs to 👉 Retail / Sales world

They do NOT measure the same thing, even if numbers look similar.

PART A — BDD GESTPAN (Consumer Panel Database)

Let’s start with BDD Gestpan, because it is more complex but very powerful.

2️⃣ What does “BDD Gestpan” mean?

Let’s split the name:

🔹 BDD

BDD = Base De Données

Means: Database

👉 Simply: a big structured database

🔹 Gestpan

Gestpan = Gestion du Panel

Means: Panel management system

👉 So:

BDD Gestpan = Database that manages consumer panel data

3️⃣ What is a “panel” in France?

Very important concept.

🔹 Panel (Panel consommateurs)

A panel is:

A fixed group of households

Who agree to:

Scan or declare everything they buy

Over a long period (months / years)

These people are called:

🔹 Panelists (Panélistes)

Normal French households

Carefully selected to represent France:

Age

Region

Family size

Income

Urban / rural

👉 Think of them as “France in miniature”

4️⃣ How does Gestpan data get collected?
Step-by-step (very important)

1️⃣ A household goes shopping
2️⃣ They buy products (food, hygiene, FMCG, etc.)
3️⃣ At home, they:

Scan the barcode OR

Upload receipt OR

Use an app

4️⃣ This data goes into Gestpan system
5️⃣ Gestpan stores:

Who bought

What they bought

How often

How much

At which store type

👉 This is individual-level data

5️⃣ What kind of questions Gestpan can answer?

Because Gestpan knows WHO bought, it can answer things like:

How many households buy Brand X?

Is Brand Y bought more by families or singles?

Do buyers repurchase or buy once?

What is the average basket?

Loyalty vs switching behavior

These are called:

🔹 Behavioral insights
6️⃣ Key Gestpan terms (slow explanations)
🔹 Household (Ménage)

One family unit

Could be:

Single person

Couple

Family with kids

🔹 Penetration (Taux de pénétration)

% of households who bought the product at least once

Example:

1,000 households in panel

250 bought product
👉 Penetration = 25%

🔹 Purchase Frequency (Fréquence d’achat)

How many times a household buys in a period

🔹 Repeat Rate

% of buyers who buy again

🔹 Panel Weighting (Redressement)

Because:

Panel is smaller than France

Data is weighted to represent all France

7️⃣ Summary of BDD Gestpan

👉 BDD Gestpan tells you:

“WHO buys WHAT, HOW, HOW OFTEN, and WHY”

It is:

Consumer-centric

Behavioral

Deep

Slower to update

Extremely rich

PART B — GPM (Retail Sales Database)

Now let’s move to GPM, which is completely different.

8️⃣ What does GPM mean?
🔹 GPM

Usually refers to Global Point de Marché

In practice: Retail sales database

👉 GPM is about what stores sell, not who buys.

9️⃣ Where does GPM data come from?

From:

🔹 Retailers (Distributeurs)

Examples:

Carrefour

Leclerc

Intermarché

Auchan

Casino

Lidl

🔹 Cash registers (Caisses)

Every time a product is scanned at checkout:

Price

Quantity

Date

Store

This data is sent to:

Nielsen

Circana

Kantar

Internal retailer systems

👉 Aggregated → becomes GPM

🔟 What does GPM measure?

GPM measures SELL-OUT, meaning:

🔹 Sell-out

What is actually sold to shoppers

Not what retailers ordered

1️⃣1️⃣ Key GPM metrics (explained simply)
🔹 Sales Value (CA – Chiffre d’Affaires)

Total € sold

🔹 Sales Volume

Total units or kilos sold

🔹 Market Share (PDM – Part de Marché)

Brand sales ÷ Total category sales

🔹 Distribution

Very important in France.

▪ DN (Distribution Numérique)

% of stores selling the product

▪ DV (Distribution Valeur)

% of category sales coming from stores that sell the product

🔹 Promotions

Promo sales vs non-promo

Depth of discount

Promo efficiency

1️⃣2️⃣ What GPM cannot tell you

GPM does NOT know:

Who bought

If same person buys again

Household type

Loyalty

👉 It only knows:

“This product was sold in this store”

1️⃣3️⃣ Summary of GPM

👉 GPM tells you:

“WHAT sells, WHERE it sells, and HOW MUCH”

It is:

Fast

Store-based

Very accurate for sales

No consumer behavior

PART C — BDD Gestpan vs GPM (Side-by-side)
Aspect	BDD Gestpan	GPM
Source	Households	Retailers
Focus	Consumer	Store
Level	Individual	Aggregated
Tells WHO bought	✅ Yes	❌ No
Tells WHAT sold	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Loyalty analysis	✅ Yes	❌ No
Market share	⚠️ Estimated	✅ Exact
Used for	Strategy, behavior	Sales, performance
1️⃣4️⃣ Why France uses BOTH

Because:

GPM answers “How is my brand performing?”

Gestpan answers “Why is my brand performing this way?”

👉 Together = complete understanding

1️⃣5️⃣ Mental model (simple)

Think like this:

GPM = CCTV camera at checkout

Gestpan = diary of real families

Both are needed.

synonym shop 



Great question — this is a very French market-research concept, and you’re right to ask for it slowly and clearly.
I’ll assume zero prior knowledge and explain what “Synonym shops” means, why it exists, and the exact process, step by step.

1️⃣ First: what are “Synonym shops”?
Important point

“Synonym shops” is NOT a retail term.
It is a data harmonisation concept used in French panel & retail databases (Gestpan, GPM, Nielsen, Kantar, Circana).

Simple definition (layman)

Synonym shops = different store names that are treated as the SAME shop in data

Why?
Because consumers don’t always name shops correctly or consistently.

2️⃣ Why do synonym shops exist? (The real-life problem)

Let’s imagine a French household (panelist):

They go shopping at:

🏪 Carrefour Market – Paris 15

When they declare the purchase, they might write:

“Carrefour”

“Carrefour Market”

“Market”

“Carrefour Paris”

“Carrefor” (typo)

👉 All of these refer to the same retail banner

If we don’t fix this:

Data becomes messy

Sales are split incorrectly

Analysis is wrong

This is where synonym shops come in.

3️⃣ What is a “shop” in panel / retail data?

Before we go further, a key concept:

🔹 Shop (Magasin)

In data terms, a shop is defined by:

Retail banner (enseigne)

Store format

Sometimes size or location

Examples:

Carrefour Hyper

Carrefour Market

Carrefour City

Each of these may be separate or grouped, depending on the study.

4️⃣ What is a “synonym” here?
🔹 Synonym (in data)

A different label that points to the same real shop or banner.

Example:

Declared by panelist	Real shop
Carrefour	Carrefour
Carrefour Market	Carrefour
Market Carrefour	Carrefour
CARREFOUR	Carrefour

👉 These are shop synonyms

5️⃣ Where is this process used?

Synonym shop processing is mainly used in:

BDD Gestpan (panelist declarations)

Sometimes in hybrid systems combining panel + retail data

GPM needs it less, because:

Retailers send standardized store codes

6️⃣ The Synonym Shops Process (step by step)

Now the core part.
Let’s walk through the full process.

STEP 1️⃣ Panelist declares the shop

Panelist enters:

Shop name (free text or selected)

Receipt / scan

Example:

“Leclerc centre”

STEP 2️⃣ Raw shop name enters the database

This is called:

🔹 Raw shop label (Libellé brut)

Unclean, unstandardized, possibly wrong.

Examples:

“Leclerc centre”

“E Leclerc”

“Lecler”

“Leclerc hyper”

STEP 3️⃣ Matching with synonym dictionary

Now the system uses a:

🔹 Synonym shop dictionary (Référentiel de synonymes)

This is a master table containing:

Official shop name

All known variations

Common misspellings

Example:

Synonym	Standard shop
Lecler	E.Leclerc
Leclerc centre	E.Leclerc
E Leclerc	E.Leclerc
STEP 4️⃣ Normalisation (very important word)
🔹 Normalisation

Process of converting multiple names into ONE standard name.

After normalisation:

All variants → E.Leclerc

STEP 5️⃣ Shop coding

Now the shop gets:

Shop code

Banner code

Circuit code

Example:

Banner: E.Leclerc

Circuit: GMS

Format: Hypermarket

STEP 6️⃣ Validation & controls

Quality checks:

Unknown shops flagged

New synonyms added

Manual validation if needed

This is ongoing.

7️⃣ Why synonym shops are CRITICAL in Gestpan

Without synonym processing:

❌ Penetration by retailer = wrong
❌ Channel split = wrong
❌ Shopper behavior = wrong

Example:

Carrefour appears smaller than reality

Purchases split across fake shops

8️⃣ Key terms explained (simple)
🔹 Ensign (Enseigne)

Retail brand name
Example: Carrefour, Auchan

🔹 Circuit

Type of retail channel
Examples:

GMS (supermarkets & hypermarkets)

Hard discount (Lidl, Aldi)

Proximity

Drive

🔹 Format

Store size/type
Hyper / Super / City / Express

🔹 Referential (Référentiel)

Official master list used as truth

9️⃣ Difference: Synonym shops vs Store grouping

Important distinction:

Concept	Purpose
Synonym shops	Clean names
Store grouping	Analytical grouping

Example:

Carrefour Hyper + Market grouped for analysis

But synonyms must be resolved first

🔟 Simple analogy (very layman)

Imagine:

“Bob”, “Robert”, “Rob”

Same person

Synonym shop process = deciding they are the same person

1️⃣1️⃣ Summary (one-screen view)

Synonym shops process ensures that all different ways of naming a store are converted into one clean, official shop identity so that analysis is correct and reliable.

Next step

If you want, you can now ask:

Synonym products

Synonym brands

Synonym shops in GPM vs Gestpan

Edge cases (Drive, Online, Franchise)


#############################
CME/BSC 


1️⃣ First: what is CME / BSC (at a high level)?

CME / BSC is about HOW a purchase is classified by retail channel and shop type in panel data.

It answers questions like:

Was this purchase made in a supermarket, hypermarket, discount store, drive, or online?

Which commercial environment did the purchase happen in?

This is not about the product.
It is about the SHOP CONTEXT.

2️⃣ Why CME / BSC exists (the real problem)

In France, people shop in many different formats:

Hypermarkets

Supermarkets

Proximity stores

Hard discount

Drive

E-commerce

Specialized stores

Panelists often say things like:

“Carrefour”

“Leclerc”

“Online”

“Drive”

“Local shop”

👉 That is not precise enough for market research.

So we need a standard way to classify the shopping environment.

That’s where CME / BSC comes in.

3️⃣ CME — explained slowly
🔹 What does CME stand for?

CME = Circuit de Mode d’Exploitation
(you may also hear Circuit de Mise en Évidence depending on institute, but meaning stays the same)

Simple meaning:

The commercial circuit in which the purchase occurred

In plain English:

“WHAT TYPE OF RETAIL CHANNEL WAS USED?”

4️⃣ Examples of CME (very important)

Here are common CME categories in France:

CME	Meaning (simple)
GMS	Supermarkets & Hypermarkets
Hard Discount	Lidl, Aldi
Proximity	City / neighborhood stores
Drive	Click & collect
E-commerce	Online delivery
Specialized	Pharmacies, bio stores

So if a panelist buys shampoo at Carrefour Hyper:

CME = GMS

If they buy it at Carrefour Drive:

CME = Drive

5️⃣ Why CME matters

CME allows analysis like:

Where does my brand sell best?

Is growth coming from Drive or Stores?

Are consumers shifting from Hyper to Proximity?

👉 Strategic retail decisions depend on CME

6️⃣ BSC — explained slowly

Now let’s move to BSC, which is often confused with CME.

🔹 What does BSC stand for?

BSC = Basket Shopping Context
(sometimes called Bloc de Situation de Consommation, depending on institute)

Simple meaning:

The shopping situation in which the purchase was made

In plain English:

“WHAT KIND OF SHOPPING TRIP WAS THIS?”

7️⃣ BSC focuses on the SHOPPING MISSION

Unlike CME (which focuses on the store type),
BSC focuses on the purpose of the trip.

Examples of BSC
BSC	Meaning
Main stock-up	Big weekly shopping
Top-up	Small refill shopping
Convenience	Emergency purchase
Planned	Planned shopping
Impulse	Unplanned buy

Example:

Buying 40 items → Main stock-up

Buying milk & bread → Top-up

8️⃣ How BSC is determined (important)

BSC is usually derived from:

Basket size

Number of items

Spend

Purchase frequency

Store type

⚠️ The panelist does NOT usually choose BSC manually
👉 The system calculates it

9️⃣ CME vs BSC (side-by-side)

This is crucial. Read slowly.

Aspect	CME	BSC
Focus	Store environment	Shopping mission
Based on	Shop type	Basket behavior
Example question	Where was it bought?	Why was it bought?
Stable	Yes	No (changes per trip)
🔟 Real-life example (step-by-step)

Let’s walk through one purchase.

Scenario

A household:

Goes to Carrefour Drive

Buys groceries for the week

Classification
Dimension	Value
Shop	Carrefour Drive
CME	Drive
BSC	Main stock-up

Now another day:

Same household

Buys milk at Carrefour City

Dimension	Value
Shop	Carrefour City
CME	Proximity
BSC	Top-up

Same household. Same brand.
Different CME and BSC.

1️⃣1️⃣ Why CME/BSC is CRITICAL in Gestpan

Because Gestpan answers:

Who buys?

How often?

In what context?

Without CME/BSC:
❌ Channel analysis impossible
❌ Shopper behavior unclear
❌ Strategy blind

1️⃣2️⃣ CME/BSC vs GPM

Important difference:

System	CME/BSC usage
Gestpan	✅ Very strong
GPM	⚠️ Limited (channel only)

GPM usually has:

Channel

Store format

But not basket mission (BSC).

1️⃣3️⃣ Simple analogy (very layman)

Think of a restaurant visit:

CME = Fast food vs fine dining

BSC = Quick snack vs full dinner

Same restaurant chain. Different purpose.

1️⃣4️⃣ One-line summary

CME tells you WHERE the purchase happened.
BSC tells you WHY that shopping trip happened.

Next step

You can now ask:

CME/BSC mapping rules

CME differences between institutes

BSC calculation logic

CME/BSC edge cases (Drive, Online)

How CME/BSC impacts KPIs




##########################

CMC 


Alright, let’s take CMC very slowly, from absolute basics, and place it exactly where it belongs in the French panel / market-research world.
No assumptions. No shortcuts.

1️⃣ First: what is CMC (big picture)

CMC is a way to describe the TYPE OF CONSUMPTION occasion behind a purchase.

Not:

the product itself

not the shop

not the shopping trip size

But:

👉 “In what consumption situation will this product be used?”

2️⃣ Why CMC exists (the real-life problem)

Let’s take a simple product:

🥤 Orange juice

You can consume it:

At breakfast at home

As a snack

During a family meal

Outside the home

From a business point of view:

These are very different moments

Brands behave differently in each moment

Promotions work differently

But sales data alone cannot tell this.

So France uses CMC.

3️⃣ What does CMC stand for?

CMC = Contexte de Moment de Consommation
(you may also hear Contextes de Moments de Consommation)

Very simple meaning:

The situation in which the product will be consumed

4️⃣ Important distinction (read carefully)

CMC is about CONSUMPTION, not PURCHASE.

This is critical.

Dimension	Focus
CME	Where it was bought
BSC	Why the shopping trip happened
CMC	How / when the product will be consumed
5️⃣ Examples of CMC (very concrete)

Let’s take yogurt.

Possible CMCs:

CMC	Meaning
Breakfast	Morning consumption
Snack	Between meals
Dessert	After a meal
On-the-go	Outside home
Family meal	Shared consumption

Same product.
Same household.
Different CMC.

6️⃣ How CMC is collected (important)

There are two main methods in France.

Method 1️⃣ Declarative CMC (panelist answers)

Panelist is asked questions like:

“When will you consume this product?”

“For which occasion?”

They select from predefined options.

✔ Very rich
❌ Depends on memory / interpretation

Method 2️⃣ Modelled CMC (derived)

CMC is inferred using:

Product type

Basket composition

Time of purchase

Household profile

Example:

Croissants + coffee → Breakfast

Chips + soda + evening time → Aperitif

✔ Scalable
❌ Less precise

Most systems use both.

7️⃣ Where CMC is mainly used

CMC is mostly used in:

BDD Gestpan

Advanced consumer insight studies

Brand strategy & innovation

GPM does not handle CMC.

8️⃣ Why CMC is extremely important for brands

CMC answers questions like:

Is my brand a breakfast brand or a snack brand?

Do consumers use it alone or with others?

Which consumption moments are growing?

This drives:

Packaging size

Messaging

Innovation

Media strategy

9️⃣ CMC vs BSC (very common confusion)

Read this carefully.

Aspect	BSC	CMC
Related to	Shopping trip	Consumption
Time	At purchase	After purchase
Question	Why did I shop?	When will I consume?
Example	Weekly stock-up	Breakfast

Example:

Weekly grocery trip (BSC)

Buy yogurt for breakfast (CMC)

Same basket. Different logic.

🔟 Full real-life example (step by step)

Let’s follow one product.

Scenario

A family:

Does weekly shopping at Carrefour Hyper

Buys cereal

Classification
Dimension	Value
Shop	Carrefour Hyper
CME	GMS
BSC	Main stock-up
CMC	Breakfast

Now same trip:

Buys chips

Dimension	Value
CMC	Aperitif

Same basket.
Different consumption moments.

1️⃣1️⃣ Key terms you should remember
🔹 Moment de consommation

Actual time/situation of use

🔹 Occasion

Social or functional context (alone, family, guests)

🔹 In-home vs Out-of-home

Where consumption happens

1️⃣2️⃣ Simple analogy (very layman)

Think of clothes:

CME = Where you bought the clothes

BSC = Why you went shopping

CMC = When you wear them
(work, party, gym, home)

1️⃣3️⃣ One-line summary

CMC explains the “usage moment” of a product — the reason it exists in the consumer’s life.

What we can do next

If you want, I can now explain:

CME + BSC + CMC together (full chain)

How CMC is modelled technically

CMC differences by category (food vs non-food)

How brands use CMC in strategy decks




####################################

polling



Alright — “Polling.ens” is one of those terms that sounds technical and mysterious, but once you break it down slowly, it becomes very logical.
I’ll explain it from zero, in plain language, and tie it back to the French panel / Gestpan ecosystem you’ve been asking about.

1️⃣ First: what does “Polling.ens” even mean?

Let’s split the term.

🔹 Polling

Comes from “poll”

Means collecting information from people repeatedly

In market research:

Asking panelists questions

Collecting regular declarations

🔹 .ens

Short for “ensemble” (French word)

Means “set / group / collection”

👉 So Polling.ens literally means:

“The set of polling data”

2️⃣ Big-picture definition (very simple)

Polling.ens is the structured dataset that contains answers collected from panelists through questionnaires or declarations.

It is:

Declarative

Survey-based

Linked to panel households

Used alongside purchase data

3️⃣ Why Polling.ens exists (the problem it solves)

Purchase data tells us:

WHAT was bought

WHEN

WHERE

But it cannot tell:

Intentions

Attitudes

Motivations

Planned usage

Opinions

So institutes poll panelists.

👉 The result of this polling = Polling.ens

4️⃣ What kind of questions go into Polling.ens?

Examples (very concrete):

“Who consumed this product?”

“For which occasion?”

“Was this purchase planned?”

“Who decided the purchase?”

“Is this product for yourself or others?”

“Was it consumed at home or outside?”

These are called:

🔹 Declarative variables
5️⃣ How Polling.ens is collected (step by step)

Let’s go slowly.

STEP 1️⃣ Trigger

A trigger occurs, such as:

A product purchase

End of week

Monthly questionnaire

STEP 2️⃣ Panelist is asked questions

Via:

Mobile app

Website

Email notification

Questions are:

Structured

Closed-ended (choices)

STEP 3️⃣ Panelist answers

They select:

One or more options

Sometimes “don’t know”

STEP 4️⃣ Answers are stored

All answers go into:

Polling.ens table

Each answer is linked to:

Household ID

Purchase ID (if relevant)

Time period

6️⃣ Relationship between Polling.ens and Gestpan

Very important.

Component	Role
Gestpan purchase data	What was bought
Polling.ens	Why / how it was bought or used

They are joined together for analysis.

7️⃣ Example (very simple)

A household buys:

Chocolate biscuits

Gestpan knows:

Product

Quantity

Shop

Polling.ens adds:

Bought for kids

Afternoon snack

Planned purchase

👉 Together = full story.

8️⃣ Key terms explained
🔹 Declarative

Information stated by the panelist, not observed

🔹 Questionnaire

Set of structured questions

🔹 Modalities

Possible answers to a question
Example: Breakfast / Snack / Dessert

🔹 Non-response

When panelist skips a question

9️⃣ Polling.ens vs CMC (important distinction)
Aspect	Polling.ens	CMC
Nature	Raw answers	Classified outcome
Source	Panelist declaration	Declaration + model
Format	Question / answer	Standard label

👉 Polling.ens is input
CMC is processed output

🔟 Why Polling.ens is critical

Without Polling.ens:

No insight into usage

No motivation analysis

No innovation learning

Sales data alone is blind.

1️⃣1️⃣ Simple analogy (very layman)

Think of a doctor:

Purchase data = medical test results

Polling.ens = patient explaining symptoms

Both are needed.

1️⃣2️⃣ One-line summary

Polling.ens is the database that stores everything panelists DECLARE through surveys about their purchases and consumption.

What can we do next?

You can now ask about:

Polling.ens table structure

How Polling.ens links to CME/BSC/CMC

Data quality & biases

Differences between institutes

Example with full data flow
