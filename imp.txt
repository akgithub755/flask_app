High-Performance Offline File Processing Engine using Python OOP

Description

Design and implement a scalable, memory-efficient offline file processing engine in Python using object-oriented principles. The system will recursively scan large directory structures, extract rich file metadata, detect duplicate files using chunk-based hashing, perform aggregate analysis, and generate structured reports. The solution must handle large file volumes efficiently, follow SOLID design principles, and be enterprise-ready with proper error handling, logging, and extensibility.
