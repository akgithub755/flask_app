Generate enterprise-grade log files with multiple modules and log levels using standard logging practices.

Stream and parse large .log files line-by-line without loading them into memory.

Extract structured fields from each log entry:

Timestamp

Error level / type

Module name

Error message

Aggregate analytics, including:

Total error count per module

Top 5 most frequently occurring error messages

Trigger alerts when:

Any module exceeds a configurable error threshold

Any error level (ERROR / CRITICAL) exceeds the threshold

Design the system using clean OOP architecture that is:

SOLID-compliant

Easily testable

Extensible for future integrations (Slack, Email, Monitoring tools)
